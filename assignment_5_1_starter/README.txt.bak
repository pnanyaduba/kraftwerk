SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

1. Proportion of the total observations who chose to accept the coupon is: 56.86%

2. Visualizing the Coupons Column. There are:
	a. 32% of Coffee House coupons
	b. 22% of Restaurant(<20) coupons (cheap restaurants)
	c. 19% of Carry out & Take Away coupons
	d. 16% of Bar coupons
	e. 12% of Restaurant (20-50) coupons (expensive restaurants)
	
3. The temperature column has the following values:
	a. 51% of the temperature column are 80
	b. 30% of the temperature column are 55
	c. 18% of the temperature column are 30
	
4. Proportion of Bar coupons accepted is: 41%

5. The acceptance rate between those who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month to those who went more is as follows:
	a. Drivers who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month: 81%
	b. Drivers who went to a bar more times in a month: 19%
	
6. The acceptance rate between drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 to the all others. 
	a. Drivers above the age of 25 who visited a bar more than once a month: 292 or 36%
	b. Drivers whose criteria are opposite of the criteria in a. above: 527 or 64%
	
	Is there a difference?
	a. There is a difference between drivers who fell in category a. above and category b. above.
	b. There is a difference of 235 drivers or a normalized 28% difference. 
	
7. Construct a null and alternative hypothesis for the difference between groups of drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 to all other drivers.
	a. NULL HYPOTHESIS, H0: Probability of going to a bar more than once a month for drivers above 25 years of age and not going are equal i.e.μ1 = μ2, 
	b. ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS, H1: Probability of going to a bar more than once a month for drivers above 25 years of age and not going are not equal i.e.μ1 ≠ μ2, 
	
	Using alpha at 0.05 to test the above hypothesis we can conclude that:
	a. The Probability of going to bar for drivers above 25 years of age and not going as a driver not above 25 years of age are not equal
	
8. The acceptance rate between drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry
	a. Drivers who visited a bar more than once a month and had passengers that are not kids and had occupations other farming, fishing or forestry: 426 or 52%
	b. Drivers whose criteria are opposite of the criteria in a. above: 393 or 48%
	
	Is there a difference?
	a. There is a difference between drivers who fell in category a. above and category b. above.
	b. There is a difference of 33 drivers or a normalized 14% difference.  

9. Compare the acceptance rates between those passengers who:
	- go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed *OR*
	- go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 *OR*
	- go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K.
	Finding
	a. There is a 59% acceptance rate among those who met the criteria
	b. There is a 41% acceptance rate among those who did not the meet the criteria
	
10. Based on these observations in 9. above, what do you hypothesize about passengers who accepted the bar coupons?
	a. Null Hypothesis, H0: Probability of accepting the bar coupons and not accepting the bar coupons are equal i.e.μ1 = μ2, 
	b. Alternative Hypothesis, H1: Probability of accepting the bar coupons and not accepting the bar coupons are not equal i.e.μ1 ≠ μ2, 
	
	Using alpha at 0.05 to test the above hypothesis we can conclude that:
	a. The Probability of accepting the bar coupon and not accepting the bar coupon are not equal
	
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION

11. Proportion of Coffee House coupons accepted

    50% of Coffee House coupons were accepted
    50% of Coffee House coupons were not accepted

12. Compare the acceptance rate between those who went to a Coffee House 3 or fewer times a month to those who went more.

    74% acceptance rate among people who went to a coffee house 3 or fewer times a month
    26% acceptance rate among people who went to a coffee house more times within a month

13. Compare the acceptance rate between drivers who go to a Coffee House more than once a month and are over the age of 25 to the all others. Is there a difference?

    305 drivers above the age of 25 visit a bar more than once a month while 509 visit less than once
    37% acceptance rate by drivers who visit more than once
    63% acceptance rate by all others
    There is a difference of 204 which is a normalized 26%
